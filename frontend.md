# soundsense-frontend

This is a prototypical frontend in a minimal viable state of the SoundSense Sensor network.
In the current state it provides you with the newest sensor values and puts them in a list. Also you can see the Markers of the sensors and where they're placed by their designated location values. You can click them and highlight the list entry of the corresponding Sensor Marker.

In future iterations of this frontend there will be graphs implemented and a replaying feature so you can look at passed datasets with a time lapse mode. Also a Heatmap will be added to show the user the noise Hotspots.
